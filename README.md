# CryptoClustering
Module 19 challenge
## Description:
By using the knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning, we will predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. In this challenge, I was able to import the necessary csv file, analyze it, scale it, find the best value for k with and without optimization technique i.e PCA and create a plot to show the clusters for both. 
 ## Installations
 I used pandas, hvplot, KMeans from sklearn.cluster , PCA fromsklearn.decomposition and StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.
 ## Other Instructions:
 Every file can be found in the Starter_Code folder.  Comments can be found above each code in jupyter notebook.

 ## Contributing
All the problems are solved with the help of the activities. Going throught the topics; Scaling Data, K-means algorithm, clustering optimization, and principal componenet analysis has helped me finish this challenge.
